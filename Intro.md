Mechanics studies how forces affect bodies in motion—how, for example, a
bullet is fired from a gun or a top is set in motion by the flick of a
wrist.  As an engineer, you will find mechanics of vital importance to
any field you choose to pursue.  Whether you are designing a bridge or
implementing an electrical power unit for an elevator, you will need to
know how to determine which forces can be applied to a body without
causing it to break, what happens when bodies collide, how an object
moves when different forces are applied to it, and so on.  This course
will introduce you to the core concepts of mechanics that will enable
you to answer these questions as you strive to design, test, and
manufacture safe and reliable products. While most universities split
introductory mechanics into two courses, with one devoted to statics and
the other to solids, this course will introduce you to both areas.  You
will begin by learning about statics—objects that are not accelerating
(in other words, objects that are either at rest or moving at a constant
speed).  In this course, you will be able to visualize and understand
how rigid bodies react to applied forces without having to worry about
how the rate of acceleration or deceleration will impact the body. 
(These considerations are for later engineering courses that study
dynamics.)  You will also learn how to solve force and moment problems
by drawing free body diagrams and applying equilibrium equations.  You
will learn to compute moments and resultants of force systems and study
internal forces exerted on members.  You will analyze trusses, machines,
and frames, as well as study the effects of friction on belts and
wedges. Once you feel comfortable with statics, you will move on to
solid analysis.  You will examine the effects that forces have on
solids.  You will understand how forces produce stress and strain and
deform bodies, as well as how bodies behave in elastic and plastic
regions.  You will study stress developed in bodies due to linear forces
and moments in pure tension or compression, bending, and torsion. In the
later sections of this course, phenomena such as bending and fracture
will come into play.  You will study stresses in beams, which are basic
objects that are used to build the framework for a number of structures,
including cars, bridges, and buildings.  You will analyze bodies and
structures for various failure scenarios such as fracture, fatigue,
creep, and buckling.  These are important concepts, as you need to know
how to design products that will not break unexpectedly.

and [ME101](http://www.saylor.org/courses/me101/). 

### Course Information

Welcome to ME102.  Below, please find general information on this course
and its requirements.   
    
 **Course Designers: **Stephanie Redfern, Ranjeet (Ron) Agarwala, and
[Dr. Steve Gibbs](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-a-g/#DrSteveGibbs)  
    
 **Peer Reviewer:** [Dr. Steve
Gibbs](http://www.saylor.org/faculty-a-g/#DrSteveGibbs)  
    
 **Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  However, the course makes primary use of the
following free, online resources:  

-   University of Nebraska­ at Lincoln: Mehrdad Negahban’s [Engineering
    Statics Notes](http://emweb.unl.edu/NEGAHBAN/EM223/Intro.htm)
-   MIT OpenCourseWare: Walter Lewin’s [Classical Mechanics Course
    Videos](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/physics/8-01-physics-i-classical-mechanics-fall-1999/)

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
Pay special attention to Unit 1, as this unit lays the groundwork for
understanding the more advanced, exploratory material presented in the
later units.  For Unit 1, the emphasis is on performing calculations.
 The second and third units are meant to introduce you to new ideas that
you may explore in depth later in your education or career.  You will
also need to complete the review exercises.  Pay special attention to
these, and to example problems, since they will provide examples
relevant to the final exam.  
  
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the final exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment:** You should be able to complete this course in
approximately **106.5 hours**.  Each unit includes a “time advisory”
that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend on each
subunit.  These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be
useful to take a look at these time advisories and to determine how much
time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to
set goals for yourself.    
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** (1) Get into a routine for studying the material
and do a little each day.  (2) Unit 1 requires extensive calculations,
so you may want to learn to make sketches of the situations involved.
 (3) Units 2 and 3 require reading complex material.  Skim through it
first for scope, and then read for a more detailed understanding.  You
may wish to revisit the complex parts several times after completing the
course.
