**Unit 2: Material Mechanics and Analysis of Solid Objects** <span
id="2"></span> 
**In this unit,* *we will examine the effects that forces have on
solids.  You will understand how forces produce stress and strain and
deform bodies, as well as how bodies behave in elastic and plastic
regions.  You will study stress developed in bodies due to linear forces
and moments in pure tension or compression, bending, and torsion.  We
will take a look at centroids, centers of mass, and moments of
inertia—structure-specific properties that are related to mass and that
help us define how an object will react to an applied force. * *We will
begin with the simplest objects in order to help you best understand new
concepts, such as stress and strain, more easily.  In its most basic
terms, stress is defined as the amount of internal force acting on an
object, per unit area.  Strain, on the other hand, is used to describe
the deformation of an object, or the change in the object’s shape as the
result of loading.  More specifically, it describes the structure’s
elongation.  For example, imagine putting an orange into a vice and
tightening it.  The soft fruit will compress, because there is a lot of
stress acting upon it.  It will also change *shape; strain often occurs
in the presence of stress.  *

**Unit2 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
-   Identify and explain appropriate formulas for the calculation of the
    properties of solid bodies including area and mass moments of
    inertia; perform those calculations.
-   Compute strain and stress, and describe the relationship of stress
    and strain for elastic, plastic, and composite bodies.
-   Compute and describe the relationship betweenstresses and strains in
    bodies subjected to tension and torsion.
-   Compute stresses and strains in pressure vessels and composites;
    identify and explain material properties for such components.
-   Identify, explain, and perform calculations involving the concept of
    a stress tensor and the constitutive relationship between strain and
    stress.
