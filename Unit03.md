**Unit 3: Bending, Yield, Fracture, Buckling and Creep** <span
id="3"></span> 
*You now know how structures will react internally when loaded with
basic axial and shear forces.  In this unit, you will take a closer look
at the overall reaction of the beam to the application of force.  When
beams are loaded with forces, they will bend.  Whenever you enter the
second floor of your home, the floor beams bend, if ever so slightly. 
When you walk up the stairs, each step changes its shape as you place
your weight on it.  This is an important concept, because bending can
preclude the fracture of a beam. *  
  
 *This unit will teach you how to determine the maximum bending stress
and strain a structure can sustain before it breaks.* *You will analyze
bodies and structure for various failure scenarios, such as fracture,
fatigue, creep, and buckling.  These are important concepts, as you need
to know how to design products that will not break unexpectedly.*

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 36.5 hours to complete.

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:
-   Identify and explain beam composition, support, and loading
    configurations.
-   Compute stresses and strains in simple, composite, and curved
    elements; explain the underlying mathematics.
-   Explain and perform basic calculations regarding the experimental
    and computational determination of strain and stress in model
    systems.
-   Categorize, explain, and perform calculations involving material
    failure scenarios including fracture, fatigue, creep, and buckling;
    compute quantities such as critical loading, creep rates, and cyclic
    loading lifetimes.

**3.2 Computational Stress Analysis** <span id="3.2"></span> 
*Note: Some of the material in this section may seem especially complex
or advanced.  You should not study it as if you need to use it to solve
engineering problems in the near future, but rather read in order to
gain an appreciation of the phenomena, nomenclature, and technology
involved.  To that end, when you read the resource materials assigned in
this subunit, you should browse through them at first and then review
them for the major points. *
