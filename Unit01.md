**Unit 1: Statics** <span id="1"></span> 
**The first unit of this course covers static analysis.  You will
briefly review vectors (graphical elements allowing you to visualize the
direction and magnitude of a physical quantity, like velocity), forces
(influences that cause unrestrained objects to accelerate), and moments
(forces that cause free bodies to rotate) in two dimensions and three
dimensions.  You will then turn your attention to “static” objects—that
is, objects in equilibrium, or objects that are either motionless or
moving at a constant speed but not accelerating.*  
    
 *Once you have a solid grasp on how to effectively examine what happens
when static structures are subjected to forces, you will learn how
friction (a force resisting the lateral movement of an object) will
affect a situation.  These concepts are basic, but you must know how to
locate and use them when physically analyzing a structure.  You will
learn to compute moments and resultants of force systems and study
internal forces exerted on members. You will analyze trusses, machines,
and frames, as well as study the effects of friction on belts and
wedges.*  
  
 *The material in this unit should be understood at a level sufficient
for application to and analysis of new situations; sample questions at
this level are included at the end of the unit.**

**1.2 Force, Moments, and Couples** <span id="1.2"></span> 
*Note: Now that you understand vectors and forces, you are ready for
moment analysis.  Moments, also known as “couples” in some situations,
are force systems that cause an object to rotate.  For example, consider
the way in which you use a wrench to loosen a nut.  The force you exert
on the end of a wrench creates a moment.  When performing structural
analysis, we will look at the sums of both the forces and the moments
acting on an object.*
